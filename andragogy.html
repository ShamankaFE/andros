				<p class="text-intro">The term andragogy can be supposedly equivalent to the term pedagogy. Andragogy in
					Greek means man-leading in comparison
					to pedagogy, which in Greek means child-leading. However, it should be noted that the term pedagogy has
					been used since
					the Ancient Greek times, while andragogy was introduced only in 19th century. What is it for and how can
					we
					benefit from Adult Learning science?</p>

					<p>The notion of <span class="accent">andragogy</span> has been around for nearly two centuries. It
						became particularly popular in
						North America and
						Britain as a way of describing adult learning through the work of Malcolm Knowles. When adult
						education first became
						popular in the early 1900s, it was assumed that the same methods and techniques used to teach children
						could also be
						applied to adults. In fact, pedagogy has come to mean the art and science of teaching, even though its
						Greek root words
						actually mean leading children.</p>

									<p class="timeline__note">"Andragogy" is connected with emerging academic and
										professional institutions, publications, or
										programs, triggered by a similar growth of adult education in practice and theory as in
										the
										United States. "Andragogy"
										functioned here as a header for (places of) systematic reflections, parallel to other
										academic headers like "biology",
										"medicine", and "physics".

										Examples of this use of andragogy are the Yugoslavian (scholarly) journal for adult
										education, named Andragogija in
										1969, and the Yugoslavian Society for Andragogy; at Palacky University in Olomouc (Czech
										republic) the Katedra
										sociologie a andragogiky (Sociology and Andragogy Department) was established in 1990.
										Also,
										Prague University has a
										Katedra Andragogiky (Andragogical Department); in 1993, Slovenia's Andragoski Center
										Republike Slovenije (Slovenian
										Republic Andragogy Center) was founded with the journal Andragoska Spoznanja; in 1995,
										Bamberg University (Germany)
										named a Lehrstuhl Andragogik (Androgogy Chair).</p>

									<h3 class="timeline__year">1968</h3>
									<p class="timeline__note">Knowles published his first article about his understanding of
										andragogy with the provocative
										title “Andragogy,
										Not Pedagogy.” Knowles’ concept of andragogy - ‘the art and science of helping adults
										learn’
										- ‘is
										built upon two
										central, defining attributes: First, a conception of learners as self-directed and
										autonomous; and
										second, a conception
										of the role of the teacher as facilitator of learning rather than presenter of content’.
										Providing a
										unifying idea and
										identity, connected with the term andragogy, to the amorphous group of adult educators,
										certainly was
										the main benefit
										Knowles awarded to the field of adult education at that time. Another was that he
										strengthened the
										already existing
										scholarly access to adult education by publishing, theorizing, doing research, by
										educating
										students
										that themselves
										through academic research became scholars, and by explicitly defining andragogy as
										science.

									<h3 class="timeline__year">1950’s</h3>
									<p class="timeline__note">Andragogy suddenly
										can be found in
										publications in Switzerland (Hanselmann), Yugoslavia (Ogrizovic), the Netherlands (ten
										Have),
										Germany
										(Poeggeler). Still
										the term was known only to insiders, and was sometimes more oriented to practice,
										sometimes
										more to
										theory. Perhaps this
										mirrors the reality of adult education of that time. There was no or little formal
										training
										for adult educators, some
										limited theoretical knowledge, no
										institutionalized
										continuity of developing such a knowledge, and no academic course of study. In this
										reality
										‘Adult
										Education’ still
										described an unclear mixture of practice, commitment, ideologies, reflections, theories,
										mostly local
										institutions, and
										some academic involvement of individuals.</p>

									<h3 class="timeline__year">1926</h3>
									<p class="timeline__note">In the 1920’s Germany, adult education became a field of
										theorizing.
										Especially a group of scholars
										from various
										subjects, the so-called ‘Hohenrodter Bund’, developed in theory and practice the ‘Neue
										Richtung’ (new
										direction) in
										adult education. Here some authors gave a second birth to the term ‘Andragogik’, now
										describing sets
										of explicit
										reflections related to the why, what for and how of teaching adults. But Andragogik was
										not
										used as
										“the Method of
										Teaching Adults”, as Lindeman (1926) mistakenly suggested in reporting his experiences at
										the
										Academy
										of Labor,
										Frankfurt, Germany. It was a sophisticated, theory-oriented concept, being an antonym to
										‘demagogy’ -
										too difficult to
										handle, not really shared. So again it was forgotten. But a new object was shining up: a
										scholarly,
										academic reflection
										level ‘above’ practical adult education.</p>

									<p class="timeline__note">Andragogy as a term reappeared in 1921 in a report by Rosenstock in
										which he argued that 'adult education required
										special teachers,
										methods and philosophy, and he used the term andragogy to refer collectively to these
										special
										requirements' (Nottingham
										Andragogy Group 1983: v). Eduard Lindeman was the first writer in English to pick up on
										Rosenstock's
										use of the term.
										He only used it on two occasions.</p>

									<p class="timeline__note">The term andragogy was first used by a German grammar school
										teacher
										named Alexander Kapp in 1833 to
										describe the
										educational theory of the Greek philosopher Plato. He used it to refer to the normal
										process
										by which
										adults engage in
										continuing education (as opposed to basic remedial education for disadvantaged or
										handicapped
										adults). Kapp does not explain the term Andragogik, and it is not clear, whether he
										invented
										it or whether he
										borrowed it from
										somebody else. He does not develop a theory, but justifies ‘andragogy’ as the practical
										necessity of

					<h2>Adult Learning (Andragogy) Principles</h2>
					<h4 class="accent-block">Principles</h4>
					<p>Adult learning is based upon comprehension, organization and synthesis of knowledge rather than
						rote
						memory. There are
						seven Principles of Adult Learning and first 4 of them were introduced by M. Knowles (Kearsley, 2010):
					</p>

					<ul class="list list--right-buttons">
						<li class="list-item">Adults need to be involved in the planning and evaluation of their
							instruction.</li>

						<li class="list-item">Experience (including mistakes) provides the basis for learning activities.</li>

						<li class="list-item">Adults are most interested in learning subjects that have immediate relevance to
							their job or
							personal life.</li>
						<li class="list-item">Adult learning is problem-centered rather than content-oriented. </li>
					</ul>

					<p>Compare it to the full version of Adult Learning Principles (Wikipedia):</p>

					<ol class="list">
						<li class="list-item list-item--decimal"><span class="accent">Adults must want to learn</span> – They
							learn effectively only when
							they
							are free to
							direct their own
							learning and have a strong inner and excited motivation to develop a new skill or acquire a
							particular
							type of knowledge, this sustains learning.</li>

						<li class="list-item list-item--decimal"><span class="accent">Adults will learn only what they feel
								they need to learn</span> –
							Adults are practical
							in their approach
							to
							learning; they want to know, "How is this going to help me right now?</span> – Is it relevant
							(Content,
							Connection and Application) and does it meet my targeted goals."</li>

						<li class="list-item list-item--decimal"><span class="accent">Adults learn by doing</span> –
							Adolescents learn by doing, but
							adults learn through
							active practice and
							participation. This helps in integrating component skills into a coherent
							whole.</li>
						<li class="list-item list-item--decimal"><span class="accent">Adult learning focuses on problem
								solving</span> – Adolescents tend
							to learn skills
							sequentially. Adults
							tend
							to start with a problem and then work to find a solution. A meaningful engagement, such as posing
							and
							answering realistic questions and problems is necessary for deeper learning. This leads to more
							elaborate, longer lasting, and stronger representations of the knowledge.
						</li>
						<li class="list-item list-item--decimal"><span class="accent">Experience affects adult learning</span>
							– Adults have more
							experience than
							adolescents. This can be an
							asset
							and a liability, if prior knowledge is inaccurate, incomplete, or naive, it can interfere with or
							distort the integration of incoming information.
						</li>
						<li class="list-item list-item--decimal"><span class="accent">Adults learn best in an informal
								situation</span> – Adolescents have
							to follow a
							curriculum. Often, adults
							learn by taking responsibility by the value and need of content they have to understand and the
							particular goals it will achieve. Being in an inviting, collaborative and networking environment as
							an
							active participant in the learning process makes it efficient.
						</li>
						<li class="list-item list-item--decimal"><span class="accent">Adults learn best in an informal
								situation</span> – Adolescents have

							learn by taking responsibility by the value and need of content they have to understand and the
							particular goals it will achieve. Being in an inviting, collaborative and networking environment as
							an
							active participant in the learning process makes it efficient.
						</li>
						<li class="list-item list-item--decimal"><span class="accent">Adults want guidance and consideration
								as equal partners in
								the process</span> – Adults
							want information
							that
							will help them improve their situation. They do not want to be told what to do and they evaluate
							what
							helps and what doesn't. They want to choose options based on their individual needs and the
							meaningful
							impact a learning engagement could provide. Socialization is more important among adults.
						</li>
					</ol>





					</p>

					<h4 class="accent-block">Application</h4>
					<p>Knowles (1984) provides an example of applying andragogy principles to the design of personal
						computer
						training:</p>

					<ul class="list list--left-buttons">
						<li class="list-item">There is a need to explain the reasons specific things are being taught (e.g.,
							certain commands,
							functions, operations,
							etc.)</li>
						<li class="list-item">Instruction should be task-oriented instead of promoting memorization --
							learning activities should
							be
							in the context of
							common tasks to be performed by the others.</li>
						<li class="list-item">Instruction should take into account the wide range of different backgrounds of
							learners; learning
							materials and
							activities should allow for different levels/types of previous experience with computers.</li>
						<li class="list-item">Since adults are self-directed, instruction should allow learners to discover
							things and knowledge
							for
							themselves
							without depending on people. However, learners should be offered guidance and help when mistakes
							are
							made.</li>
					</ul>





					<p>Educators teaching adult learners need to know the concepts of the adult learning theory and be able
						to
						incorporate them
						into their teaching style. Educators need to become <span class="accent">facilitators</span> of adult
						education, helping the adult
						learner to set
						and achieve goals and guide them in choosing the subjects and courses needed to fulfill these goals.
						They
						need to keep
						in mind that the adult learner needs to know why the course is important to their learning and life
						situation. The adult
						learner brings into the continuing educational arena a rich array of experiences that will affect the
						learning styles
						and assimilation of knowledge. Adult learners need to be able to apply the knowledge into their life
						situations.</p>

					<p class="note">In a constructive approach teachers should see themselves as facilitators and
						co-learners. Teachers must bear in mind,
						however, that learners are individuals with different life experiences and learning preferences. </p>


					<h4 class="accent-block">Optimal Adult Learning</h4>
					<p>Neuroscientist and educator Eric Jensen's factors for optimal learning (Jensen, 1998) include:</p>
					<ul class="list list--left-buttons">
						<li class="list-item">Whether the material has personal meaning to the learner;</li>
						<li class="list-item">Circumstances present;</li>
						<li class="list-item">Personal-concept (a person's collection of thoughts about beliefs, experiences,
							values and
							knowledge);</li>
						<li class="list-item">Mode of sensory input (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory, gustatory);
						</li>
						<li class="list-item">Information processing (learning styles, processing states like linear,
							holistic, random, logical,
							concrete, reality
							based, temporal, non-temporal...etc., artistic/analytic orientation, abstract/concrete... etc.);
						</li>
						<li class="list-item">Responses (theory of multiple intelligences)</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="note">Some
						adult learners
						will still prefer the traditional pedagogical approach to teaching and learning as they simply used to
						it from school. Teachers should
						respect that, but gradually try to push learners away from their comfort zone in the direction of a
						deeper
						approach to
						learning.</p>
