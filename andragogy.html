        <p class="text-intro text-intro--main">The term andragogy can be supposedly equivalent to the term pedagogy. Andragogy in Greek means man-leading in comparison to pedagogy, which in Greek means child-leading. However, it should be noted that the term pedagogy has been used since the Ancient Greek times, while andragogy was introduced only in 19th century. What is it for and how can we benefit from Adult Learning science?</p>

          <p>The notion of <span class="accent">andragogy</span> has been around for nearly two centuries. It became particularly popular in North America and Britain as a way of describing adult learning through the work of Malcolm Knowles. When adult education first became popular in the early 1900s, it was assumed that the same methods and techniques used to teach children could also be applied to adults. In fact, pedagogy has come to mean the art and science of teaching, even though its Greek root words actually mean leading children.</p>

                            <p class="timeline__note">&quot;Andragogy&quot; is connected with emerging academic and professional institutions, publications, or programs, triggered by a similar growth of adult education in practice and theory as in the United States. &quot;Andragogy&quot; functioned here as a header for (places of) systematic reflections, parallel to other academic headers like &quot;biology&quot;, &quot;medicine&quot;, and &quot;physics&quot;. Examples of this use of andragogy are the Yugoslavian (scholarly) journal for adult education, named Andragogija in 1969, and the Yugoslavian Society for Andragogy; at Palacky University in Olomouc (Czech republic) the Katedra sociologie a andragogiky (Sociology and Andragogy Department) was established in 1990. Also, Prague University has a Katedra Andragogiky (Andragogical Department); in 1993, Slovenia's Andragoski Center Republike Slovenije (Slovenian Republic Andragogy Center) was founded with the journal Andragoska Spoznanja; in 1995, Bamberg University (Germany) named a Lehrstuhl Andragogik (Androgogy Chair).</p>

                            <p class="timeline__note">Knowles published his first article about his understanding of andragogy with the provocative title &quot;Andragogy, Not Pedagogy&quot;. Knowles' concept of andragogy - 'the art and science of helping adults learn' - 'is built upon two central, defining attributes: First, a conception of learners as self-directed and autonomous; and second, a conception of the role of the teacher as facilitator of learning rather than presenter of content'. Providing a unifying idea and identity, connected with the term andragogy, to the amorphous group of adult educators, certainly was the main benefit Knowles awarded to the field of adult education at that time. Another was that he strengthened the already existing scholarly access to adult education by publishing, theorizing, doing research, by educating students that themselves through academic research became scholars, and by explicitly defining andragogy as science.</p>

                            <p class="timeline__note">Andragogy suddenly can be found in publications in Switzerland (Hanselmann), Yugoslavia (Ogrizovic), the Netherlands (Have), Germany (Poeggeler). Still the term was known only to insiders, and was sometimes more oriented to practice, sometimes more to theory. Perhaps this mirrors the reality of adult education of that time. There was no or little formal training for adult educators, some limited theoretical knowledge, no institutionalized continuity of developing such a knowledge, and no academic course of study. In this reality 'Adult Education' still described an unclear mixture of practice, commitment, ideologies, reflections, theories, mostly local institutions, and some academic involvement of individuals.</p>

                            <p class="timeline__note">Andragogy as a term reappeared in 1921 in a report by Rosenstock in which he argued that 'adult education required special teachers, methods and philosophy, and he used the term andragogy to refer collectively to these special requirements' (Nottingham Andragogy Group 1983: v). Eduard Lindeman was the first writer in English to pick up on Rosenstock's use of the term. He only used it on two occasions.</p>

                            <p class="timeline__note">The term andragogy was first used by a German grammar school teacher named Alexander Kapp in 1833 to describe the educational theory of the Greek philosopher Plato. He used it to refer to the normal process by which adults engage in continuing education (as opposed to basic remedial education for disadvantaged or handicapped adults). Kapp does not explain the term Andragogik, and it is not clear, whether he invented it or whether he borrowed it from somebody else. He does not develop a theory, but justifies 'andragogy' as the practical necessity of the education of adults.</p>

          <p class="text-intro">Since, Eduard C. Lindeman's pioneer paper in 1926, The Meaning of Adult Education, which awakened interest in and set the basis for the systematic research about how adults learn, educators and psychologists have contributed to the development of many varied theories and hypothesis about the learning characteristics of adults. Taylor and Hamdy summarized the learning theories and classified them in the following categories:</p>

          <h2 class="article-content__title">Adult Learning (Andragogy) principles</h2>
          <h4 class="accent-block">Principles</h4>
          <p class="text-intro">Adult learning is based upon comprehension, organization and synthesis of knowledge rather than rote memory. There are seven principles of Adult Learning and first 4 of them were introduced by M. Knowles (Kearsley, 2010):</p>
          <ul class="list list--right-buttons">
            <li class="list-item">Adults need to be involved in the planning and evaluation of their instruction.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Experience (including mistakes) provides the basis for learning activities.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Adults are most interested in learning subjects that have immediate relevance to their job or personal life.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Adult learning is problem-centered rather than content-oriented.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Compare it to the full version of Adult Learning principles (Wikipedia):</p>
          <ol class="list">
            <li class="list-item list-item--decimal"><span class="accent">Adults must want to learn</span> - They learn effectively only when they are free to direct their own learning and have a strong inner and excited motivation to develop a new skill or acquire a particular type of knowledge, this sustains learning.</li>
            <li class="list-item list-item--decimal"><span class="accent">Adults will learn only what they feel they need to learn</span> - Adults are practical in their approach to learning; they want to know, "How is this going to help me right now? - Is it relevant (Content, Connection and Application) and does it meet my targeted goals."</li>
            <li class="list-item list-item--decimal"><span class="accent">Adults learn by doing</span> - Adolescents learn by doing, but adults learn through active practice and participation. This helps in integrating component skills into a coherent whole.</li>
            <li class="list-item list-item--decimal"><span class="accent">Adult learning focuses on problem solving</span> - Adolescents tend to learn skills sequentially. Adults tend to start with a problem and then work to find a solution. A meaningful engagement, such as posing and answering realistic questions and problems is necessary for deeper learning. This leads to more elaborate, longer lasting, and stronger representations of the knowledge.</li>
            <li class="list-item list-item--decimal"><span class="accent">Experience affects adult learning</span> - Adults have more experience than adolescents. This can be an asset and a liability, if prior knowledge is inaccurate, incomplete, or naive, it can interfere with or distort the integration of incoming information.</li>
            <li class="list-item list-item--decimal"><span class="accent">Adults learn best in an informal situation</span> - Adolescents have to follow a curriculum. Often, adults learn by taking responsibility by the value and need of content they have to understand and the particular goals it will achieve. Being in an inviting, collaborative and networking environment as an active participant in the learning process makes it efficient.</li>
            <li class="list-item list-item--decimal"><span class="accent">Adults want guidance and consideration as equal partners in the process</span> -  Adults want information that will help them improve their situation. They do not want to be told what to do and they evaluate what helps and what doesn't. They want to choose options based on their individual needs and the meaningful impact a learning engagement could provide. Socialization is more important among adults.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4 class="accent-block">Application</h4>
          <p>Knowles (1984) provides an example of applying andragogy principles to the design of personal computer training:</p>
          <ul class="list list--left-buttons">
            <li class="list-item">There is a need to explain the reasons specific things are being taught (e.g., certain commands, functions, operations, etc.)</li>
            <li class="list-item">Instruction should be task-oriented instead of promoting memorization - learning activities should be in the context of common tasks to be performed by the others.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Instruction should take into account the wide range of different backgrounds of learners; learning materials and activities should allow for different levels/types of previous experience with computers.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Since adults are self-directed, instruction should allow learners to discover things and knowledge for themselves without depending on people. However, learners should be offered guidance and help when mistakes are made.</li>
          </ul>
          <div>Educators teaching adult learners need to know the concepts of the adult learning theory and be able to incorporate them into their teaching style. Educators need to become <span class="accent">facilitators</span> of adult education, helping the adult learner to set and achieve goals and guide them in choosing the subjects and courses needed to fulfill these goals. They need to keep in mind that the adult learner needs to know why the course is important to their learning and life situation. The adult learner brings into the continuing educational arena a rich array of experiences that will affect the learning styles and assimilation of knowledge. Adult learners need to be able to apply the knowledge into their life situations.</div>
          <p class="note">In a constructive approach teachers should see themselves as facilitators and co-learners. Teachers must bear in mind, however, that learners are individuals with different life experiences and learning preferences.</p>
          <h4 class="accent-block">Optimal Adult Learning</h4>
          <p>Neuroscientist and educator Eric Jensen's factors for optimal learning (Jensen, 1998) include:</p>
          <ul class="list list--left-buttons">
            <li class="list-item">Whether the material has personal meaning to the learner;</li>
            <li class="list-item">Circumstances present;</li>
            <li class="list-item">Personal-concept (a person's collection of thoughts about beliefs, experiences, values and knowledge);</li>
            <li class="list-item">Mode of sensory input (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory, gustatory);</li>
            <li class="list-item">Information processing (learning styles, processing states like linear, holistic, random, logical, concrete, reality based, temporal, non-temporal...etc., artistic/analytic orientation, abstract/concrete... etc.);</li>
            <li class="list-item">Responses (theory of multiple intelligences).</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="note">Some adult learners will still prefer the traditional pedagogical approach to teaching and learning as they simply used to it from school. Teachers should respect that, but gradually try to push learners away from their comfort zone in the direction of a deeper approach to learning.</p>
