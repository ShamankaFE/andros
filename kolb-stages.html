        <p class="text-intro text-intro--main">David Kolb published his learning styles model in 1984 from which he
          developed his learning style inventory. Kolb's experiential learning theory works on two levels: a four
          stage cycle of learning and four separate
          learning styles. Much of Kolb's theory is concerned with the learner's internal cognitive processes.
          Kolb states that learning involves the acquisition of abstract concepts that can be applied flexibly in a
          range of situations: <span class="accent">"Learning is the process whereby knowledge is created through
            the transformation of
            experience"</span>. How can we make use of it? Just by experiencing it...

          <h2 class="article-content__title">Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle</h2>
          <p class="text-intro">Kolb's experiential learning style theory is typically represented by a four stage
            learning cycle in which the
            learner 'touches all the bases':

            <li class="list-item list-item--decimal"><span class="accent">Concrete Experience</span> a new
              experience of situation is encountered, or a reinterpretation of existing
              experience.</li>

            <li class="list-item list-item--decimal"><span class="accent">Reflective Observation</span>
              of the new experience. Of particular importance are any inconsistencies
              between experience and understanding.</li>

            <li class="list-item list-item--decimal"><span class="accent">Abstract Conceptualization.</span>
              Reflection gives rise to a new idea, or a modification of an existing

            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>A typical presentation of Kolb's two continuums is that the east-west axis is called
            the Processing Continuum
            (how we approach a task), and the north-south axis is called the Perception Continuum (our emotional
            response, or how we think or feel about it).</p>

          <p class="note">It is possible to enter the cycle at any stage and follow it through its
            logical sequence. However, effective learning only occurs when a learner is able to execute all four
            stages of the model. Therefore, no one stage of the cycle is an effective as a learning procedure on
            its own.</p>

          <h2 class="article-content__title">Kolb's Learning styles</h2>
          <p class="text-intro">Learning styles are a habit of learning based on individual preference, choice,
            life
            experience, education, culture, and
            the current situation or context. Kolb offers a Learning Style Inventory that provides an interesting
            self-examination
            of an individual's approach to learning based on four learning styles: Diverging, Assimilating,
            Converging, and
            Accommodating. Remember, you use more than one learning style and they can shift based on the
            situation Curious about
            which learning styles you prefer?</p>

          <figure class="image-block image-block--center">
            <img class="article__image" src="img/kolb-cycle1.jpg" alt="Kolb learning styles">
            <figcaption class="text-source">Source of image: www.simplypsychology.org/learning-kolb.html
            </figcaption>
          </figure>


          <h4 class="accent-block">Diverging (watching and feeling - CE/RO)</h4>

          <p>These people are able to look at things from different perspectives. They are sensitive. They prefer
            to watch
            rather than do, tending to gather information and use imagination to solve problems. They are best at
            viewing
            concrete situations at several different viewpoints.
            Kolb called this style 'diverging' because these people perform better in situations that require
            ideas-generation,
            for example, brainstorming. People with a diverging learning style have broad cultural interests and
            like to gather
            information.
            They are interested in people, tend to be imaginative and emotional, and tend to be strong in the
            arts. People
            with the diverging style prefer to work in groups, to listen with an open mind and to receive personal
            feedback.
          </p>
          <p class="note">People with this learning style are more on the creative side of the spectrum. They like
            to imagine great extents, which
            help them come up with unique ideas. Divergers rely mostly on the first two stages of the cycle.
            Diverging learners appreciate a facilitator who is affirming, draws out motivation and self-knowledge,
            creates personal
            relationships, and fosters dialogue.</p>

          <h4 class="accent-block">Assimilating (watching and thinking - AC/RO)</h4>
          <p>The Assimilating learning preference is for a concise, logical approach. Ideas and concepts are more
            important
            than people. These people require good clear explanation rather than practical opportunity. They excel
            at
            understanding wide-ranging information and organizing it in a clear logical format.
            People with an assimilating learning style are less focused on people and more interested in ideas and
            abstract
            concepts. People with this style are more attracted to logically sound theories than approaches based
            on
            practical value.
            This learning style is important for effectiveness in information and science careers. In formal
            learning situations,
            people with this style prefer readings, lectures, exploring analytical models, and having time to
            think things
            through.
          </p>

          <p class="note">Such learners take onto everything with the support of known information. They prefer
            conceptualization and reflection
            in absorbing information more effectively. Assimilating learners appreciate a subject expert who has a
            reflective authoritative style, systematically analyzes and
            organizes subject matter, and delivers knowledge by lectures and texts.</p>

          <h4 class="accent-block">Converging (doing and thinking - AC/AE)</h4>
          <p>People with a converging learning style can solve problems and will use their learning to find
            solutions to
            practical issues. They prefer technical tasks, and are less concerned with people and interpersonal
            aspects.
            People with a converging learning style are best at finding practical uses for ideas and theories.
            They can solve
            problems and make decisions by finding solutions to questions and problems.
            People with a converging learning style are more attracted to technical tasks and problems than social
            or
            interpersonal issues. A converging learning style enables specialist and technology abilities. People
            with a
            converging style like to experiment with new ideas, to simulate, and to work with practical
            applications.
          </p>

          <p class="note">These learners usually focus on the third and fourth stages of the cycle. They like to
            experiment. For these
            individuals, it is important to apply their knowledge practically. Hence why they love technical
            tasks. Converging learners appreciate a standard setter and evaluator who has an objective
            results-oriented style, sets
            performance objectives, and structures performance activities to evaluate learning.</p>

          <h4 class="accent-block">Accommodating (doing and feeling - CE/AE)</h4>
          <p>The Accommodating learning style is 'hands-on', and relies on intuition rather than logic. These
            people use other
            people's analysis, and prefer to take a practical, experiential approach. They are attracted to new
            challenges and
            experiences, and to carrying out plans.
            They commonly act on 'gut' instinct rather than logical analysis. People with an accommodating
            learning style
            will tend to rely on others for information than carry out their own analysis. This learning style is
            prevalent within
            the general population.
          </p>

          <p class="note">Individuals with this learning style approach new tasks welcomingly. Their style is
            practical which is why their
            learning mostly comprises the last stage in the cycle. Accommodating learners appreciate a coach who
            has an applied collaborative style, works one-on-one with learners to
            apply and refine their ongoing learning in context, and uses feedback mechanisms and development
            plans.</p>

            Kolb believed that we cannot perform both variables on a single axis at the same time (e.g. think and
            feel, watch and do). Our
            learning style is a product of these two choice decisions.
            It's often easier to see the construction of Kolb's learning styles in terms of a two-by-two matrix.
            Each learning
            style represents a combination of two preferred styles. Have you detected yours?</p>

                  <span class="accent">common sense</span>. <span class="accent">Imaginative learners</span>
                  conceptualize these experiences, whereas <span class="accent">analytical
                    learners </span>apply and
                  refine the ideas too.
                  <span class="accent">Dynamic learners </span>make use of all the steps but mainly base their
                  learning on their personal
                  interpretation.

                <p>The Honey Mumford model is pretty similar to the Kolb model. It introduces the following

                <ul class="list">
                  <li class="item-list"><span class="accent">Activists: </span>Active learners do things
                    practically to gain knowledge from
                    them.</li>
                  <li class="item-list"><span class="accent">Theorists: </span>People who like to learn from
                    existing facts and figures
                    fall
                    into this category.</li>
                  <li class="item-list"><span class="accent">Pragmatists: </span>Such individuals conceptualize
                    and experiment with ideas
                    before they learn from them.</li>
                  <li class="item-list"><span class="accent">Reflectors:</span> These learners reflect on what
                    they see and learn from it.

                <h3 class="tab-content__title">Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model</h3>
                <p>This learning model is focused on the fact that every individual has their own preference
                  when
                  it comes to the process
                  of grasping new information. Certain individuals may have multiple preferences, some may
                  shift
                  from one to the other,
                  and some have only one.</p>

                <ul class="list">

                  <li class="item-list"><span class="accent">Active and reflective learners,</span> as the name
                    suggests, are very
                    hands-on. Active learning
                    is
                    their favorite method to
                    learn.</li>

                  <li class="item-list">On the other hand, <span class="accent">sensing and intuitive
                      learners</span> focus on written
                    facts and concepts.
                    They can
                    be presented with
                    pre-existing ideas, and they will not have any issues memorizing them. For example, if a
                    PR
                    strategist can work better based on previous research instead of
                    experimenting around in real-life
                    situations with new ideas, it would account for this style.</li>

                  <li class="item-list"><span class="accent">Sequential and global learners</span> prefer
                    organized and systematic
                    learning.</li>

                  <li class="item-list"><span class="accent">Visual and verbal learners</span> go for
                    supporting tools such as words and
                    graphics.</li>

              <h2 class="article-content__title">Kolb's recommendations</h2>
              <p>Remember that experiential learning takes work and time; it should be purposeful and beneficial
                to
                your learning. Kolb and Kolb (2011) suggest the following principles as a guideline:
              </p>
              <ul type="list">
                <li class="item-list">respect learning and others' experience;</li>
                <li class="item-list">begin learning with the experience of the subject matter;</li>
                <li class="item-list">create and hold a hospitable space for learning;</li>
                <li class="item-list">make space for conversational learning;</li>
                <li class="item-list">make space for acting and reflecting;</li>
                <li class="item-list">make space for feeling and thinking;</li>
                <li class="item-list">make space for inside-out learning;</li>
                <li class="item-list">make space for development of expertise; and</li>
                <li class="item-list">make space for learners to take char of their own learning (2011, p.
                  61-62).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p class="text-post">Both Kolb's learning stages and cycle and his successors' ideas could be used by
              teachers to critically evaluate the learning provision typically available to students and by
              learners
              -
              to organize self-directed learning process in a most efficient way.

          Thank you for showing your interest into the Adult Learning. This project
          was
          created in the process of self-directed learning too. Always remember to love what you do as I
          love to create modern and functional websites in the EdTech and service
          industries.
