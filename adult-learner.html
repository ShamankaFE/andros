				<p class="text-intro">The essential meaning of the concept of andragogy has to do with adults. The Greek,
					aner
					(genitive andros), means “man”, while agein means “to lead”; so andragogy means “leading men,” which can
					be
					paraphrased as “leading adults”. Knowles defined andragogy as “the art and science of helping adults
					learn”. So who are these adult learners?</p>

				<div class="article-content__chapter chapter" id="01">
					<h2>Specific traits of Adult Learner</h2>

					<p>In the 1970s, Malcolm S. Knowles developed a model to explain the characteristics of learning in
						adults
						based in the following assumptions:</p>

					<h4 class="accent-block">The need to learn</h4>

					<p>Adults need to know why they need to learn something before undertaking to learn it. They need to know
						how
						learning will be conducted, what learning will occur and why learning is important. The pedagogical
						implications
						of this assumption are that:</p>
					<ol>
						<li class="item-list">It is important to know and understand the learner's expectations and needs
							through
							needs assessments
							(an
							evaluation of what the learner needs to know about the subject matter, performed prior to the
							teaching
							intervention by asking teachers and/or students). These allow for appropriate planning, in order to
							avoid
							the mistake of teaching content so basic that students already know it (the lecture is viewed as a
							waste
							of
							time) or so difficult that they find it impossible to understand (they lack the knowledge base to
							understand
							the content) or they find it irrelevant to their needs
						</li>
						<li class="item-list">It is fundamental to introduce goals and objectives at the beginning of the
							lecture
							- what learners will
							be
							able to know or do with the knowledge acquired during the lecture</li>
						<li class="item-list">It is good practice to present an outline at the beginning of the lecture to
							give
							the learners a preview
							of
							what they will learn.</li>
					</ol>

					<h4 class="accent-block">The learner's self-concept</h4>
					<p>Adults have the self-concept of being responsible of their own decisions and their own lives and
						consequently
						need
						to be considered by others as capable of self-direction. Teachers should help their adult students
						become
						self-directed learners: Learners that are able to control, motivate, supervise and adjust their own
						learning.36
						Encouraging active learning (where students actively participate in their learning – through debates,
						questioning,
						case
						resolution) over passive learning (where students just sit back and expect to be ‘fed’ by the teacher)
						is
						one
						strategy for
						helping students make a transition from dependent to self-directed learners.</p>

					<h4 class="accent-block">The role of learner's experiences</h4>
					<p>Adults come to learning situations with accumulated experience; therefore, in any group of adults
						there
						is a
						wide
						range of individual differences regarding background, learning styles, motivation, needs, interests
						and
						goals.
						Also, adults tend to develop mental habits, biases and assumptions that usually make them resistant to
						new
						ideas
						and
						alternative methods of learning.</p>
					<p class="note">This concept suggests the inclusion of techniques that take into consideration the
						learner's’
						experience. Group discussions, debates, case-based methods, etc., are examples of techniques in which
						students
						may
						evaluate, reflect
						and review their own experience in light of what is being taught. Additionally, constructivist
						learning
						theories
						suggest that new information must connect to previous knowledge in order to be understood, retained
						and
						then
						utilized.</p>

					<h4 class="accent-block">Readiness to learn</h4>
					<p>Adults are ready to learn what they need to know to cope with the situations they face in their real
						lives.
						This
						principle supports the relationship between the content to be taught and the learner's developmental
						stage.
						For
						example, a lecture about phacoemulsification with premium intraocular lenses might not be relevant for
						first-year
						residents, although it would be useful for third-year residents.</p>

					<h4 class="accent-block">Orientation to learning</h4>
					<p>Adults will be motivated to learn as long as they perceive the learning as useful to help them perform
						tasks
						or
						solve problems they face in their lives. They will learn more effectively when new knowledge, skills,
						attitudes
						and values are presented in the context of their application to real life situations.</p>
					<p class="note">This concept implies that the content of lectures should be relevant to what learners
						need
						to
						cope
						with in their daily practice. The instructor's experience on the subject matter (presented through
						personal
						stories or cases) adds to the relevance that the audience may find in the content.</p>

					<h4 class="accent-block">Motivation</h4>
					<p>Although adults respond to external motivators (better jobs, promotions, higher salaries, etc.) the
						most
						powerful
						motivators for learning are internal pressures (the desire for increased job satisfaction,
						self-esteem,
						quality
						of
						life, etc.).</p>
					<p class="note">Letting learners know why they need to know a topic or what they will be able to do with
						the
						knowledge acquired
						from the lecture (i.e., to present goals and objectives) can increase motivation during lectures, as
						well
						as
						the
						inclusion of activities, debates and question.</p>

					<h2>Life Span Development of Adult Learner</h2>

					<p class="text-intro">
						Lifelong learning is knowledge-intensive and fluid. The clear divide between education followed by
						work is
						not
						as
						clear as it once was. As such, considerable theory and research has focused on life span development.
						Vygotsky called the difference between an individual’s current level of ability and accomplishment and
						the
						individual’s potential level the zone of proximal development. Learning stimulates awareness of
						potential
						and
						of the gap
						between current knowledge and skills and one’s potential level. This awareness stimulates more mature,
						internal
						development processes. People become aware that they need to learn and they also become more aware of
						how
						they
						learn. As this
						occurs, they are likely to try more complex ways of learning that require deeper thinking and
						learning.
					</p>
					<p>According
						to Kegan’s model of life span development, a person
						moves
						to increasingly complex “orders of mind,” deeper levels of self-understanding and awareness of how
						others
						see
						the
						world—qualitatively different levels of social construction:
					</p>

					<div class="block-stages-wrap">
						<div class="block-stages">
							<span class="block-stages-item block-stage1">Stage 1: Cognitive processes of a young
								child.</span>

							<span class="block-stages-item block-stage2">Stage 2: Older children, teens, and some
								adults
								whose feelings are
								inseparable from those of others.</span>

							<span class="block-stages-item block-stage3">
								Stage 3: (“Traditionalism”) Teens and many adults who distinguish between their own and others’
								viewpoints
								but feel responsible for others’ feelings. As such, they are terrific team players. More than
								50%
								of all adults do not proceed beyond this third stage.
							</span>

							<span class="block-stages-item block-stage4">
								Stage 4: (“Modernism”) People who have a sense of self that is separate from a connection to
								others.
								They
								are autonomous and self-driven, self-governing and principled, but they do not quite understand
								the
								limits
								of self-governing systems.
							</span>

							<span class="block-stages-item block-stage5">
								Stage 5: (“Postmodern”) People who come to recognize the limits of their own system of
								principles — a
								stage
								of
								cognitive development that happens before midlife, if it is reached at all.

					<div class="block-stages-age">
						<p>
							Other stage models focus on ages and related life and career transitions. Hall’s career growth

							</li>
							<li class="list-item">continued growth, maintenance, or decline and
								disengagement <span>(after age 45)</span>.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Levinson’s career growth curve distinguished between: </p>
						<div class="list2-wrap">
							<ul class="block-stages-age-list list2">
								<li class="list-item">preadulthood <span>(birth to about age
										22)</span>,
									the
									formative period of defining and developing
									relationships and gaining a sense of self; </li>
								<li class="list-item">early adulthood <span>(ages 17–45)</span>,
									when the
									individual
									defines and develops relationships and gains a
									sense of independence, the biologically peak years that may include the
									emergence of satisfaction from career advancement, creativitiy, and achievement of major
									goals or
									may
									be
									marked by
									disappointment and stress with overwhelming financial obligations, marriage problems, and
									parenting
									troubles;
								</li>
								<li class="list-item">possible midlife transition <span>(ages
										40–45)</span>,
									with a new sense of individuation and contentment;
								</li>
								<li class="list-item">middle adulthood <span>(ages 40–65)</span>,
									with
									diminished biological capacity but potential for personally and
									socially satisfying life and mentoring others;</li>
								<li class="list-item">
									late adult transition <span>(60–65 and beyond)</span> with the potential for continued
									generative
									and
									reflective
									development, but for many, a time of physical or mental decline.
